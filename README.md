# real-time-stock-market-data-engineer-project
In this project, we’ll build a real-time stock market data pipeline using Snowflake, DBT, and Apache Airflow. We’ll stream live market data from an API, orchestrate transformations, manage data in Snowflake, and deliver powerful visualizations — creating a portfolio-ready project that makes you stand out.
